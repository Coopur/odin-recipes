# odin-recipes
# Introduction: I will be building a basic recipe website 
# I will be using my HTML skills that I have acquired through the odin project foundations course
# This website will consist of the home page then 3 other pages each containing one recipe
# I will be demonstrating my skills with making links, adding images, adding headings, making paragraphs, making unordered and ordered lists and also demonstrating my skills with using Git. I will be practicing making good commits and then pushing my final project to Git Hub once done. 
# The recipes featured will be recipes that I use at my house to make high protein and delicious meals 

# Reflection: This took me roughly an hour and a half - 2 hours. Had some trouble at the beginning and had to restart the project. Once I restarted everything was pretty smooth sailing. I had to go back and review my notes a little bit but by the time I got to working on my 3rd recipe I could tell the things I've learned so far are really starting to click. Very fun to finish this and say I've built my first website. Excited to see what more I will learn in the future of this course.
