# odin-recipes
# Introduction: I will be creating a basic recipe website
# This project will demonstrate my newly acquired beginner skills in HTML
# I will demonstrate my ability to create headings, links, add images, creating both unordered and ordered lists, organize an HTMl boiler plate, I will also be practicing using my terminal and GIT to make commits and pushing them to Git Hub
# The project will consist of 3 total recipes each of them being recipes I use very often when I cook for myself
# The recipes chosen are what I eat very regularly because of the high amount of protein in them and because they are very good

# Reflection:
