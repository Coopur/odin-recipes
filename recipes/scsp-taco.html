            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Below features a taco comprised of steak,chicken, shrimp and pineapple. Steak, chicken and shrimp are great together but the addition of grilled pineapple just makes the taco taste even better.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Steak</li>
                <li>Chicken Breast</li>
                <li>Shrimp</li>
                <li>Pineapple</li>
                <li>Tortillas</li>
                <li>Shredded Mozzarella Cheese</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>Fill bowl up with hot water and thaw shrimp inside</ol>
            <ol>Cut up steak and chicken</ol>
            <ol>Grab however much pineapple you want and put in bowl</ol>
            <ol>Put chicken, steak and shrimp onto grill on high setting</ol>
            <ol>Put your tortillas on the other side of the grill on the medium setting</ol>
            <ol>Let your meat cook about 75% of the way then put the pineapple on with it</ol>
            <ol>Once one side of the tortilla is good and crispy flip it and sprinkle mozzarella cheese on it</ol>
            <ol>The cheese will melt some on the tortilla</ol>
            <ol>Once the meat is cooked to your liking and the tortilla looks good simply put the meat and pineapple into the tortillas</ol>
